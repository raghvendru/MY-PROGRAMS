Approach used in the below program is as follows
Declare an array of integers which contains pairs of sides of rectangle.( Arr[] )

Create a variable to store the size of the array. (n)

The function maxArea(int arr[],int n) is used to calculate the maximum area for rectangle. It takes an input array and its size as arguments.

Inside maxArea() we declared an array Dim[2] two store highest two sides found after traversing the sorted array (in descending order) arr[].

As arr[] is sorted in descending order the highest 4 sides must be in the beginning. We will iterate arr[] such that a pair of sides is found.

Initialize Dim[] with 0 at first.

Inside the while loop we put the condition that it continues till j<2 that there are no values found for dim[0] and dim[1] or the end of arr[] is reached. (i<n).

If a pair of such sides is found, ( if(arr[i]==arr[i+1]) ), then store it in dim[j] and increment j for next side.

Return the result as a product of dim[0] and dim[1].

Note âˆ’ sort(arr,n) is supposed to sort arr in descending order.
